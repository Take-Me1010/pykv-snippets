Enjoy Kivy!

## Future works

- implement auto import.
  - if you type `Button` and there is no import, add import statement automatically or by some command.

## Attention / Comments

- This extension does not depend on kivy version.
- Please feel free to contact me if you want to implement additional snippets!
